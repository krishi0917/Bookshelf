A bookshelf can be considered as software to keep track of all the books.
At any point of time, any new book can be added to the bookshelf provided the bookshelf has a capacity or any book can be taken out of the bookshelf. Now whenever the user takes the book out of the bookshelf , it is no longer available to the other users. Every book is been issued for only 7 days.
I have also maintained a tab to check all the books that are not been returned within 7 days.

a)	Operating the software is very simple. Since, it is a single page web application all the facilities can be done easily.

b)	Expected output is to get the data in a tabular format and getting the data in a lucid manner. We can get the complete list of data whenever we navigates to the website. On Clicking add books tab, we will be asked to add the details of a new book and will then be added in the list. I have also maintained 2 different tabs Show issued books and Show overdue which will shoe all the books that are issued to whom and all the books that are not return on time  respectively. Also, a search option will let you search the books by ISBN, author name etc.
